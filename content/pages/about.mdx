Hello World! I'm **Trinh Dinh Tai**, a **front-end developer** from Ha Noi, Vietnam. As a developer, I am passionate about design and code, and
I enjoy creating web application interfaces and functionality with **React.js** or **Next.js**.

## More

I've always had a great interest in computers and technology. I was eager to study as much as possible at such a young age. One of my first computer experiences was creating my website, which had a poor interface and design, lol ðŸ¤£.

So now I concentrate on the specifics, and I'm passionate about creating software products that appear both accessible and easy to manage.

I'm a proactive and adaptable worker and learner who enjoys being a part of internationally remote teams where people are prioritized and values such as trust, kindness, and inclusiveness are valued. I'm always up for a challenge that will allow me to improve and broaden my skill set.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy watching anime, playing video games with friends, and spending time with them or my family. I'm constantly listening to music, so check out the website footer to see what I'm listening to right now.

If you're interested in the hardware and software tools I use every day to help me get the job done, please visit the `usage` page.

## Contact

I adore my job and take much pleasure (and occasionally frustration) in every project I undertake. Please look at my portfolio.
